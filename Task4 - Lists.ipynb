    "**1)** Use a consistent number of spaces for indentation. The most common convention is to use four spaces for each level of indentation.\n",

    "**4)** Use a text editor or IDE that can highlight indentation errors. This can be very helpful in catching indentation errors early and fixing them quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5)** Don't copy and paste code blindly. If you copy and paste code from another source, make sure to check the indentation and adjust it to match your code style.\n",
