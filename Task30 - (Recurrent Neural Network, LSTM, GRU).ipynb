    "Both LSTM and GRU have been developed to improve the ability of RNNs to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. They have been widely adopted in various applications where sequential modeling is crucial. The choice between LSTM and GRU depends on the specific task and dataset, as their performance may vary in different scenarios."
