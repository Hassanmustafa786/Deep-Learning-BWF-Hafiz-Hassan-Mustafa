    "# Feature Engineering Techniques\n",
    "Feature engineering is the process of selecting and transforming raw data into features that can be used to train machine learning models. It is an important step in the machine learning pipeline that can have a significant impact on the performance of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some popular feature engineering techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Imputation:** This technique involves filling in missing values in the dataset. Common methods include replacing missing values with the mean or median of the feature, or using a predictive model to estimate missing values.\n",
    "2. **One-Hot Encoding:** This technique converts categorical variables into binary features, where each possible value of the categorical variable is represented by a binary feature. For example, if a categorical variable has three possible values, it can be transformed into three binary features.\n",
    "3. **Feature Scaling:** This technique involves scaling the values of numerical features to a common scale to prevent one feature from dominating the others. Common methods include standardization (scaling to zero mean and unit variance) and normalization (scaling to a range between 0 and 1).\n",
    "4. **Feature Selection:** This technique involves selecting a subset of features that are most relevant to the prediction task, while removing irrelevant or redundant features. Common methods include correlation analysis, mutual information, and feature importance ranking.\n",
    "5. **Polynomial Features:** This technique involves creating new features by combining existing features using polynomial functions. For example, if a dataset has two features, x and y, we can create a new feature by computing x^2, y^2, or x*y.\n",
    "6. **Text Processing:** This technique involves processing textual data to extract features that can be used to train machine learning models. Common methods include tokenization, stemming, and stop word removal.\n",
    "7. **Time Series Features:** This technique involves extracting features from time series data, such as trends, seasonality, and autocorrelation.\n",
    "8. **Dimensionality Reduction:** This technique involves reducing the number of features in the dataset while retaining as much information as possible. Common methods include Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)."

    "# Data Preprocessing Techniques\n",
    "Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline, which involves cleaning, transforming, and preparing raw data for machine learning models. Here are some popular data preprocessing techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Cleaning:** This technique involves removing or correcting errors, missing values, outliers, or duplicate data in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Transformation:** This technique involves transforming the raw data into a format suitable for machine learning models. This may include normalization, scaling, binning, or encoding of categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Extraction:** This technique involves extracting relevant features from the raw data that can be used to train machine learning models. This may include text processing, image processing, or time series analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Feature Selection:** This technique involves selecting a subset of features that are most relevant to the prediction task, while removing irrelevant or redundant features. This may include correlation analysis, mutual information, or feature importance ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Dimensionality Reduction:** This technique involves reducing the number of features in the dataset while retaining as much information as possible. Common methods include Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Data Augmentation:** This technique involves generating new data from the existing data to increase the size of the dataset or to balance the class distribution. This may include random rotations, translations, or flips for image data, or adding noise or perturbations to numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Handling Imbalanced Data:** This technique involves addressing the problem of imbalanced class distribution in the dataset, where one class has significantly fewer samples than the other classes. This may include oversampling, undersampling, or the use of weighted loss functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Data Partitioning:** This technique involves splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets, to evaluate the performance of the machine learning model on unseen data. Common methods include k-fold cross-validation and stratified sampling."
